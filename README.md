# HTML-CSS-Projects
This repository contains the files and projects I used while learning HTML and CSS at https://www.internetingishard.com/

Course Introduction:
Interneting Is Hard is a HTML & CSS tutorial to web development. Over a dozen chapters cover every aspect of crafting a quality web page, thousands of code examples explain each HTML element and CSS property, and a textbook worth of words provide important real-world context around when and why youâ€™d want to use each of them.
